title: Handling Conflict

*This is our system... I think?*

When two players go for the ball, the one that spoke out-loud has priority. The one who didn’t speak should recognize this and pull away from the shot. Often with a classic shout of “Yep” or “Ya” or a good old fashioned “DON’T MIND ME”

Overlapping calls is common. Discord delay, chaos, “lag on the skype”, it just happens. Sort it out and move on, don’t stress or worry about it.

Prioritize whoever spoke *most recently*. If two people speak at the same time, follow up with repetition. That one (the confident one) goes. Not double committing is usually more important than making sure the “right person” goes, so you only call off someone else’s out-loud call if it’s a matter of scoring or not scoring.

While double-commiting for an aerial, call out if you are continuing to hit the ball ("I got") or if you are going to flip out of it and recover ("You got").

Remember, mid-game is not the time to decide or reflect on who *should* have gone. It's the time to sort out your rotations and recover quickly.
