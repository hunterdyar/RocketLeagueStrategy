How do you get out of defense?

Getting out from offensive pressure is one of the hardest things for a team to do, because it requires a lot of communication with your team. There are different approaches that you may find yourself able to capitalize on.

First, make sure you understand [challenge advantage](challengeAdvantage.md). It is key for knowing when to play safe, and when to take risks, when making a move out of defense.

## Solo Play

The simplest way to leave defense is to simple take the ball and leave. Easy! Can you get a clean touch on the ball and beat two challenges from the other team? 

## Clear it to Kansas

Just send that baby flying. Backboard half-volley clears tend to be particularly powerful, and hard to control. Just send it.

## Clear to a teammate

Watch BDS play in EU RLCS. Every big hit out of defense doesn't just go *away*, somebody is there to reach it. Look for your players who just took challenges or might be grabbing the side boost, and when you clear the ball, clear it in that direction.

For the up-field player, 

## Side-Wall Double Touch

Knock the ball to the side wall, but follow it in the air. Double touch it out. This play works because its unexpected, and difficult to read. It's hard to read if a player will land the double touch, and hard to read where that ball could go.

In general, the side walls and corners can be used buy space. You can hit the ball away from the other team, but not further away from yourself - you can get back to it.

## Infield from your own corner or side wall

Pass the ball in front of your own net! Obviously, this is dangerous. But when you are playing in the corners, and the other team is attacking the corners, a low tight pass that your defender can reach with space is an extremely effective way to break defense. It buys space for the same reason a back-pass buys space, the offensive team isn't prepared to attack that aggressively. 

What's more dangerous, hitting the ball to the other team, or hitting it to a teammate?

## 50/50 your way out

50 out of defense is an incredible powerful, yet underrated, way to relieve pressure.

 It's made possible from a simple behavior in 50s: When one player is instigating the 50, bringing the momentum to the collision, it is harder for that player to recover afterwards. In 50s, you can recover faster than the opponent by staying low - sometimes not even jumping, or single jumping the 50 and then flipping right after to recover. The attacking player, so to speak, is probably flipping into it, and probably bouncing off of it.

If you're inviting the opponent to take a 50 against you, you can control it better and recover faster.

So, on defense, sit behind the ball and *let the other team come challenge you.* Make them possession cost them something, don't give it away for free. If the 50 goes neutral, you still forced the other team to use boost and use up a player in order to continue their offensive pressure, while you spend significantly less. 

More likely, you can get *multiple 50s in a row.* You can 50 one player, and then get back to the ball before the second offensive player gets there. You can beat them with a touch or another 50, and just like that you have the challenge advantage and are free of pressure.
