title: Rotations

## Standard Rotations

Player 1 hits the ball. They leave the play ("rotate out") to position 3. Player two takes over play on the ball (becomes position 1), and player 3 moves to support player 2.

All players path over boost while moving between positions. Position 1 rotating to position 3 often grabs the back corner boost.

> I will use Player "A", "B", and C" to refer to players who were at positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively, at the start of the described play.

## Cutting Rotation

Player A (1) challenges in their offensive corner, and begins rotating out. Player B (was 2, now 1) challenges, and the ball pops in a situation that A can make a good play on it, instead of C. Maybe A has a great recovery or managed to steal the opponents boost, maybe C went all the way back home for boost. A "cuts" rotation and turns to make the next play the ball. Cutting is frequently done while keeping strong pressure in the opponent's corner. Clear communication between A and C is important.

Reporting when one gets boost amounts, and if an opponent "has it", allows the cutting player know if they should prioritize retreat or the ball. They are likely glancing off ball-cam to spot available boost during recovery. It's generally up to B/C to make reports on opponents.

> In general, the players who are further back and have better sight on positions can report positions to the players who are in the "thick of it", so to speak. Players that are in the play can report heads-up information ("I am going to lose this challenge") that gives them earlier or better reads on a play.

## Cycling

During Rotations, one calls out that they are cycling if they are switching positions with or taking a position from a teammate. Usually in messy corner rotations. Lets the teammate know where to go. Cycling comes from 2v2 comms/play. One can also call cycling between position 3 and the recovering or cutting position ex-1. 

Cycling can often happen when a small weird 2v2 situation pops up in a corner, it’s important to comm so the 3rd player doesn’t join the party.

Cycling also often happens in ones own defensive corner, when its not always clear who should go for a challenge. 

## Rotations and Spacing

There’s a rhythm to rotations, where after you recover and ‘get back’, you have "freed up" the previously-back player to move forward into a more aggressive position. 3 moves to 2 after 1 recovers to 3. Rotating back quickly gives your teammates more options.

If you (3) wait until a teammate is behind you to push forward, that's often too late! There’s an inefficiency when you are overlapping in positions. Like a traffic jam rippling down a highway. If you are 3 and you see your teammate forward, still recovering, still not back, and you move forward anyway. Now this is too early to change your position. The net goes unguarded.

This is either called an "overlap" or a “gap” in rotation. 

*Clean* rotations are when you don't have any gaps or overlaps in your rotation.

## Rotations and Speed

A faster team isn’t faster because their cars go faster. A faster team is faster *as a team* when the timing to their rotations are efficient.

Being a fast player isn’t always about being the first to the ball - ball chasing, cutting rotation, etc. If you feel your team is being beat to the ball by a faster team, don’t question your speed or reflexes - you can’t fix that mid match. Instead, check your rotations, and start being more specific with communicating your movement. I promise it works. 

To play faster, first you need to clean up your rotations, then speed up the rotations as a team. If one player decides "I'm going to play very fast" but the teammates are not on the same page, the whole team probably becomes slower - spending more time out of position, overlapping/leaving gaps.
