- **50 out of defense:** 

- - Invite, basically, opponents to challenge the ball in your corner or sidewall plays. Don’t rush the ball into then, let them come to you.
  - If they want the ball, they better spend something to come get it.
  - Defense uses less boost then offense and buys time in this situation. It’s a safe, easy way to leave defense when a team is boost starved. Just gotta be better at taking 50s - first player tries to *not lose* the 50 more than *win* the 50 to a teammate, and will find yourself suddenly able to easily transition to offense - the other team threw themselves out of position against you.

- **Infield pass**: Position 1 passes from the offensive corner or sidewall to the middle area in front of the net, where a teammate (2) can shoot. Dangerous. An infield pass to the 3rd position player (while 1 is still recovering, or going for bumps) is a risky play indeed. Why do we go for this so often? *(ed: Because it kicks ass fuck you).*

- **Chase**: Comes from the ice hockey strategy of "dump-n-chase" which is a rather ugly term for an effective play. Throw the ball into the opponent's corner, high up on the wall, and force them to use boost to make a clear or touch. Go for a challenge or dunk, and if you catch the other opponents still on transition, they can be too awkward to counter attack.

- **Outlet**:

- - Passing the ball from the wall forward to the center, high up in the air. 
  - A counterattack move, where the defense in position 1 has the ball on the wall, the corner, or just won a challenge. Position 2 - and often, the previous position 1 who hasn't had time to rotate back yet - moves forward and center, and the defender passes it from the defensive wall to midfield.
  - One way to outlet is for position 1, in the corner, to just not even go for the challenge. Maybe they missed it on accident, maybe got faked. To leave defense with a hyperotation into an outlet pass can be a risky play that works at every level... and is oddly popular in rumble for some reason. 

- **Backpass**:

- -  Ever love it when the opponent beefs their clear and player C can just bang it back over to B or go for an air play or do anything? Well what's easier than an opponent messing up? Just giving it to them yourself. Back-pass! 
  - Make sure position C knows it is your intention to do this. Kasey.

- **Fake**: Make what looks like a play on the ball that forces the opponents to respond, hopefully jumping or something to take them out of the play for a bit. You don't actually do anything. A fake shot is flying past the ball into a fast recovery, while the defender flew past the other way. You both have to recover, but you landed on their backboard and got their boost, and they are flailing out to narnia. A fake challenge is another beast of intricacies, and one usually says "fake challenge" for fake challenges, and "fake" for fake shots, fake passes, fake kickoffs, or ironically after you whiffed. One might shout faking when they mean ‘missing’. Even if you haven’t accidentally fooled an opponent (who was faked by your miss).... It’s fine, we get it.

- **Low 50/50**:

- -  A certain kind of 5050 where you take 50's like you are trying to kill the ball on kickoff. You are positioned to recover before the opponent (thanks to boost turning your car into a beefy boi). 
  - Sometimes you don’t even jump, or only single-jump and boost, or single jump the challenge, but delay the until flip after the opponent does. This doc isn’t for teaching 50/50 strats.
  - If the opponent jumps to block a quick shot/normal challenge, they will push the ball into you, where it will die in your control, and they will bounce off the ball up in the air, since you have the support of the ground. You then shoot or continue doing whatever. 

- **Tee-Up** or **Tee**: One player controls the defense by dribbling the ball with the option of a flick, but instead of flicking, drives (usually laterally) towards a teammate. This teammate shoots it off of their hood. If the first player single jumps, a pinch will get extra power or an unexpected and hard-to-read exit trajectory. Sadly, tee-ups are most often done accidentally, and the player who had a PERFECTLY GOOD FLICK and COMPLETE CONTROL has now double-committed.

- **Flying V**: When one player is dribbling the ball and another (just one still counts) is just *right there* with them, maybe looking for a demo or tee-up, probably just out of position and double committing, but we're gonna go with it. Flying V!
