title: Risk/Reward Model for Adaptation
---

Risk/Reward or Aggressive/Defense is a way of thinking that gives you a single axis (er, variable?) around which to adapt and coordinate decision making as a team.

Position 1, 2, and 3 all have a level of aggression or defensiveness they can apply to a situation. 

> Never take a risk, you will lose every game. Take every risk, you will lose every game. 

Situational awareness, reading the other team, adapting to the other teams style, is all important. You can improve at this stuff by playing 1s and 2s. Pay lots of attention to the riskiness of any position, when you get punished, and how you punish opponents.

Basically, we can reach many complex decisions from a single team-shared consideration: Risk vs. Reward.

>  Every action in rocket league has a cost. You are playing in the future, you have to move before things happen. You have to jump before you can flip. Boost gets used. Net is left behind. Everything has a risk, everything has a reward. 

## Situational Adapting

Micro-level play-by-play adapting. Do we all have boost? Did we get a cheeky demo? We can recover faster, let’s go for gold. 

Did the opponents double-commit, or backflip, or some other mistake? Time to let yourself play more aggressively, because there isn’t as much risk from the opponents, aggressive decisions become less risky. 

Similarly, defensive positions might be necessary in situations where the opponents have the advantage. Stay patient, wait for your moment.

This is fundamental Rocket League. If you’ve played past bots, you understand this on *some* level.

## Opponent Adapting

The basic idea is to spend the first 30-60 seconds getting a read on the opponent, and finding at least one weakness they have. Send some testing shots, see what they do when you go up a wall or dribble, etc. Maybe you identify poor backboard defense, a single bad player, or an over-aggressive push by their 2nd player into our corner. Once we find that one weakness, we know where we can adjust, and make a more aggressive and riskier play in this situation in order to force and then punish their mistake or weakness.

While doing that, we also find one strength of the opponent (Maybe they can land clean double touches, they like passing dimes, they are 50/50 walls, a certain good player). We decide to play less risky in these situations, more defensive. 

If one makes an adaptation on just one strength and one weakness of an opponent, then that’s usually enough to creep a win. More than that is, in my opinion, too much to consider during a single match. But when playing bo3 in tournaments, you know this is what we’re chatting about in between games.

Another way to think about things is not a single game at a time, but just marking why you get scored on. My friends and I have a tradition of saying what we messed up during the replay. Sorry new friends, we’re not trying to be so critical of you! Just a habit! During a long session, this can be less mentally taxing than the constant game-by-game analysis.

*The RL Ranked ladder means the opponent is the same skill as us. They beat teams we beat, they lost to teams we lost to. If we figure out why, and then we change ourselves accordingly, then we will win more games then we lose in a ranked session. Usually. Hopefully. Eventully.*

## Gameplay Adapting

We also adapt to the macro level gameplay. Down by 2 with 60-45 seconds left? Yeah, take the risk. Up by 1 with a minute left? Play safer. Of course.

Making sure all teammates adjust at the same time is SO IMPORTANT because that is how you throw - a player makes an infield pass to a teammate that was staying safe, the other team counter attacks and you lose. You were on different levels of risk/reward, expectations aren't met, mistakes go punished.

## Position Balancing

As a default... If positions 1 & 2 are playing aggressive, 3 should be defensive. If 2 & 3 are defensive, 1 can be aggressive. We never go "all in" without case, and we also don't go “all-back”. is probably giving the opponents time to set up something nasty. We balance where our aggression/defensiveness is, and shift it around continuously. Most of this is done by the player in position 2.

## Player Balancing

We also adjust our risk-reward situation to the strengths of our players. Say one of us is great at goal-line defense (KaPow). Another one of us may trust that, and take a risk (SorrySorrySorry takes time to steal boost during retreat). This sort of stuff takes time playing with each other. 

Remember the joke comms where “you saves those” “you scores those”. That stuff, but on a rotation level. "I have time to get boost." "I trust, I trust"
