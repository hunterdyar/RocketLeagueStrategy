Ballchasers! *The worst.*

The term “ballchasing” gets used a lot, and everyone seems to mean something a little bit different. So let’s define it for ourselves. I’m going to be more particular and specific, because I want to give you ballchasing as a tool, not as an insult to mindless players who just challenge everything.

>  Johhnyboi talks about ballchasing around the 10 minute mark in [this 1s showmatch video](https://youtu.be/HZTnWU9hurU?t=592).

When you are deciding to go for a ball or a challenge *before* you have a read on the play, you are ballchasing. You are committing to a decision before you have the information you need to “properly'' make this decision. You have superhuman reflexes. Except you don’t, you’re just *going*. No matter how fast your opponents reads are, they can’t be faster than a pure ballchaser, because a ballchaser didn’t even consider if the opponent could beat them to it. They’re just *going*. The ballchaser, what a madlad.

It’s also a surprise. You are cheating reflexes and reads by making a bet, and the bet is that your opponent *will* be waiting and reading and reacting, and you can get an advantageous position if you just *go*. Turning on “ballchasing mode” for like 5-10 second snippets can be really effective way to throw off your opponents expectations. Kasey and I used to start our 2v2 matches with like 30 seconds of crazy ballchasing, and then just go play normal for the rest of the game. First impressions are lasting impressions, and it throws off the other team. Short sprints of ballchasing will *absolutely* mess up your opponents rhythm and tempo, and is one of the better ways to mess up your opponents rotations (the best being demos).

> The best time to ballchase is when a teammate tells you to. You are *for sure* on the same page.

There’s another way to define of ballchasing, which is overstaying your welcome in a play. Not rotating out. After you get a first touch, you go for another. You cut rotation all the time because you think you can turn 180 degrees faster than your 3rd teammate can drive forward 5 feet. You’re CLOSER damnit! That means HIT BALL. This ballchasing I don’t like so much. Not because it can’t catch the opponents off-guard (That’s a good thing. Being weird, and even bad, can be a good thing!) It throws your *teammates* off-guard. Just not worth it. Also you end up without boost and useless, and then you’re out of the play for much longer than you would be.
