> Oh so much to be written about boost control and how it affects risk/reward, positioning, micro-positioning, pathing, rotation timing, and more. Maybe I’ll write my thoughts on it down one day.... 

## Call out boost grabs

Calling out boost information - what you steal, if the other team is starved, when/where you grab boost - is more helpful than you may realize. For example, calling the back boost can help your teammates passively determine the timing of when that boost will be back (10 seconds later), and they may adjust their rotations or pathing accordingly.

Next, glance up at the time left when you grab a big boost. It's easy to mentally count down 10 seconds and know when it will pop back up. Do this consciously in order to eventually develop your game sense to include boost spawns.

Also, glance at the clock during kickoffs. 10-13 seconds after kickoff, the boost that was grabbed during kickoff will pop back up.

## Steal the Little Pads

It's worthwhile to steal the 12 boost pads in front of the opponents net while you are applying pressure. Often picking up 12 or 24 boost while in net is what allows a player to make a goal-line save. Those pads are the most valuble to a defending team.

It's not usually worthwhile to go out of your way to grab them, since they respawn quickly: after 3 seconds. It's worth it when the defense are nearby: such as scrums in front of the opponents net, and when an opponent is chasing you.  

## It's Risky to Double-Boost grab on Kickoff

Stop it.

Double-boost grab leave you in a sticky situation if you lose posession after the kickoff. You are likely to lose posession, without doing a backwards-win kickoff, the other team will be closer to the kickoff ball most of the time. You'll use boost getting into posession, and if you lose another challenge, you area half-starved with no big boost pads to get for 10 seconds.

Don't do it without reason to take the risk.

## Win Boost Races when you can

You and an opponent race to the boost - do your best to win it. An opponent pathing out of their way to get boost, and not getting it, is putting them extra out of position. If you are in a race to the boost, and it's not likely you will win it, give up and path over small pads, and don't forfeit your position.

## Force Boost out of Opponents

Once you have a boost starve established, you don't want to just keep playing normally. Focus on plays that will require the opponents to use boost to play effectively. 

Some strategies force opponent boost usage

- Aerial heavy plays: high lobs on the ball, air dribbles, towards their net, backboard hits, lateral passes.
- Mess up the opponents rotations and recoveriers: demos, bumps, backpasses, lateral passes, rotation direction changes. Win races to boost, secure mid boost.
- Shoot (even if it isn't threatening). Shots accross the net usually get saved in the same direction, and you can beat the opponent to the follow up. Shooting directly in between two opponents can get them to double commit, not having time to decide who makes the save.
- Force out boost in the little plays: invite 50/50s, don't clear the ball except to a teammate, keep the speed of the game up, keep threats active.
