> Oh so much to be written about boost control and how it affects risk/reward, positioning, micro-positioning, pathing, rotation timing, and more. Maybe I’ll write my thoughts on it down one day.... 

I’ll say this for now: calling out boost information - what you steal, if the other team is starved, when/where you grab boost - is more helpful than you may realize. For example, calling the back boost can help your teammates passively determine the timing of when that boost will be back (10 seconds later), and they may adjust their rotations or pathing accordingly.

Next, glance up at the time left when you grab a big boost. It's easy to mentally count down 10 seconds and know when it will pop back up. Do this consciously in order to eventually develop your game sense to include boost spawns.

Also, glance at the clock during kickoffs. 10-13 seconds after kickoff, the boost that was grabbed during kickoff will pop back up.
