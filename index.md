Almost 3k hours and I'm only writing this down now lol. Positions, Rotations, Terms, Communication, Kickoffs, other stuff. This is not a complete guide, I'm just writing down the parts I have opinions on. If you're here to learn Rocket League meta, this won't teach everything.

Help from Flash and KaPow.

This started as a shared doc where I wrote down the “shouts” so we could all agree on our comms. It just kind of ballooned into more. I'll likely start coaching a collegiate team in the future (I work for a university that is trying to start an eSports program), so that motivated me somewhat too.
