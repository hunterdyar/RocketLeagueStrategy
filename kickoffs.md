title: Kickoff Theory

Kickoffs are the only set-pieces in the game. Have a plan and be on the same page.



Generally.....

## Kickoff Guidelines

We have the non-kickoff players tell our kickoff taker where they plan on going. Instead, for whatever reason, if the person taking kickoff says something like “right” or “cheat”, then that is the law now. For us, the person taking kickoff has the final say on the kickoff play, including a call for faking.

- The “left-goes” rule-of-thumb are always **secondary** to anything communicated. Voice > in-game chat > left. 
- Flash doesn’t “do” kickoffs.
- Don't get double boost. This leaves us with full boost, but the timing on the boost respawns means you won’t be able to fill up, it's unlikely you will be grabbing back boosts at the same time, you would rather have them dithered. This is an aggressive play for pushing forward hard.

#### Cheating Player

For the cheating player, their priorities before transitioning into position 1/2 are, in order:

- Score on an open net.
- Get possession of the ball/stop the other team from getting possession. (But not weakly shooting at a defending net. Consider dribbling the ball to the corner and looking for a wall pass instead of always going for the shot).
- Steal midfield boost from the other team
- Leave midfield boost for the kickoff-taker (who has the least boost right now).

#### Boost-Grabbing Player

For the back boost grabbing player, they should:

- Go to the back boost behind the kickoff-takers position. This is because the kickoff-taker will likely land on the *other side*, moving across. If they don’t get the side boost, they likely turn back to position 3, and grab the back boost that we want to be big and juicy and wait for them.

- - For this reason, on double-diagonal kickoffs, it's usually better for the opposite diagonal player to cheat, and the back-middle player to go grab boost. *Uh, why don’t we do this?*

- Take a fast, tight turn. Learn powerslide turns! 
- They should not go up to the wall.
- They should not start boosting forward until they see the play.
- They should be able to get back to the net quickly.
- Won’t save a banger, but could save a roller.
- They should default to turning *backwards towards net* if the other teammate is on a cheat, and only turn *upfield* if the 3rd player is playing in net, or only doing a very soft cheat to the second pad (and already this is an aggressive position, despite not having a followup on the ball).

#### Staying In-Net Player

For the player not getting boost, nor cheating, they should: 

- Creep forward and grab the nearby 12 pad.
- Just be ready for what's next, safely sliding into rotation

#### Player On Kickoff

The kickoff-goer should be focusing on recovering fast. Their kickoff should be focused on *not getting scored on*, *recovering quickly*, and *gaining possession.*

- We do not always want to go for the lose-to-corner play. It’s countered easily at our level, and we lose to a hard cheat frequently.
- One should try to leave some boost in the tank to recover with.
- One should aim to hit the ball center, and not high or weird that they bounce up and away, or two far to the side that the net is open. (fumbling the hook-style kickoff)
- They should probably side-flip into the challenge. This keeps the front of the ball flat - nice big challenge area - for the longest duration of time. This will prevent the car from bouncing away or having a slow/odd recovery.
- One should land far enough away from the ball to do this. Try flipping earlier, but not so early you lose speed from acceleration. Good kickoffs are hard, and all muscle memory. 
- One should have a stable, safe kickoff they can rely on that they won’t fumble and will be able to score. Usually a slightly slower kickoff that, even if they speed-flip, they won’t score instantly on it.
- If you mess up the flip or approach, and you didn’t overshoot it, you can still probably boost back into some kind of shot-blocking position. I’ve “recovered” many fumbled kickoffs with a wavedash. Have that in your toolbelt.

# The Double Wide Kickoff

The double wide kickoff is interesting, because in my opinion, most players play it ***wrong*** when doing their standard approach. 

Most players tend to have the non-kickoff-taking wide player grab the back boost pad that's behind them, while the middle player cheats (or stays in net).

I think this is backwards. I think the wide player should cheat forwards, and the back player should grab boost. Why? They should grab the boost that's behind the kickoff-taking player. You want to take the boost behind the kickoff-taker when they come from the corner, and leave the other boost available for them. Just like when deciding who goes fpr boost during the single-wide kickoff.

On a wide-approach kickoff, the players taking the kickoff tend to land on the opposite side they started, facing the opposite side they started. This way, the back corner is going to be available for the kickoff-taking player. There is no downside to this approach. One player has boost, the other is cheating fine.

For the cheating player, it's easy. You have 12 boost you can grab.  I like to diagonal-flip without boosting as much as a kickoff, and position behind the kickoff player facing the opponents net. The cheating player has room to adjust since they start closer than the opposing cheating player, assuming the opposing team did the kickoff the dumb normal way.
