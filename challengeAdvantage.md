# Challenge Advantage

[Back to Home](index.md)

The simplest and easiest way to think about challenges is to consider your position vs. the position you are challenging. In other words, how many  teammates you have behind you vs. how many they have behind them. If you’re both position 1, it’s like a kickoff - pretty neutral. If you’re position 1 and you’re up against 3 - their last line of defense - you  have a major **challenge advantage**. 

 A lot of “possession” play isn’t purely about playing “keepaway” from the other team, but when you have to take a challenge, you consistently have the challenge advantage. A number of challenges in a row where you have the advantage will likely develop into a solid shot opportunity.

Challenge advantage also indicates when it is appropriate to “clear and chase”  (you’re chasing 1st will challenge their 2nd/3rd) and when one should not ‘just whack the ball’ clear, giving away possession. (You are giving it to their position 1: they are fully supported).

Play will sometimes devolve into ugly, boring, nothing play. Neither team has a challenge advantage for a stretch of time, neither team has a  boost advantage, the ball is playing ping pong, bleh. In this situation, just don’t get antsy and make the first mistake. If you're ahead in points, this is a okay place to be - killing the clock and killing their offense.
