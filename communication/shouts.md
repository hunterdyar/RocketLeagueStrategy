title: Shouts

---

A shout is a short informative saying. Usually just one word. It’s a command, a request, a suggestion, or a play. Shouts help a team make decisions together. The classic shout is “I got it”.

Shouts can often be informative (I am here) or commands (you go there), depending on the context. Basically, if the player is on the ball shouting "wing" or "cover" they mean "go there", and if the player is not on the ball, they mean "i got u boo".

*Note: I don’t mean literally shouting... necessarily. It can also mean “decision”, in some contexts. Like “that was a good shout” is slang for “that was a good call”.*

*Trying to make this a complete list, but don’t mind if I skip an obvious entry like “I got it”, “got again” or “Bumping”.*

- **Mine, Yours, Me, Not-Me,** a players **name** with no other context: Disambiguate who is or should be going for the ball. Often player C should tell A/B who should be going for the ball. If you hear your name like this, and are hesitating, stop thinking and go for it. Trust the shout.

- **They Have/[Xyz] Has**: Same as above, but informing that the other team has a touch, or has the ball. (xyz is the other players name, or just ‘they’). It’s very helpful to know when you shouldn’t go for a challenge because you aren’t going to win it.

- **On/Off:** That ball is/isn’t going to go into a net. It’s usually easier for a player who isn’t in the net (making the save) to quickly read if the ball is going into the net or not. The player in the net may hesitate trying to read it from their awkward perspective.

- **Starved**: “I do not have boost, and boost is now a high priority for me. Play to buy time, not aggression, and don't use much boost yourself, so we can be boosted up when we are ready to make play”

- **Dive:** Basically you are calling that you are challenging, but also that the challenge is risky and/or recovery may be slow, and/or your confidence in it is low (so don’t believe in this one, stay safe). Telling someone else to dive is like shoving them into a pool. If you hear “dive” and you’re position 1.... Turn your brain of and go.

- **Buying Time**: "I recognize you are out of the play or starved, and I am playing to prevent the other team from doing anything that requires anyone other than myself to handle." Maybe driving the ball up the wall, maybe a nice air-dribble into an inevitable 50-50, maybe a full-solo play. The purpose of the play is to let the teammates get what they need to get (ie: back, boost, to net), and teammates should trust and do what they need to (ie: it’s maybe okay to go get corner boost, depending on the panic level). It's good to tell your teammates when you are doing this, because it might look like you are akward or hesitating.

- **I'm First**: Used in defense to say "While I am perhaps shadowing/backboard/waiting right now, but once the opponent makes a move I intend on being the first person to react to it. I will be doing this, do not also react and double commit with me". Most often needed when two defenders find themselves in the same position (which is bad), like deep in net, or one is in a hard-to-read position, like a defender in the net and one on the backboard.

- **Over Me:** I can’t hit that ball. Probably because it is too high up for me to reach, or traveling too fast.

- **Back/Front/Mid + Left/Right**: Refers to the big boost canisters. "Got back-left" "got right-mid". Easy passive communication that lets us know where to expect boost to not be, and who has boost and can make a play. Especially useful to call available back boosts if a teammate got demoed, so they don't need to spend a split second looking at the pad when they spawn.

- **Slow Back** or **Out of the play**: I am not going to be able to make it back to position 3 in time for the rotation for whatever reason. Adjust your plans and positioning accordingly.

- **50**: Take a 50/50, as a command.

- **Cover** / **Covering**: A is covering B if A is in position for B losing their play/challenge. Covering gives the on-ball player permission to go for a challenge. Retreating players might shout covering to let the defenders know they are now back (or will be back) behind them, and that defender can push forward. Might be shouted by the challenging player if what they are doing is risky, like the third position player who leaping for a big aerial. "Hey, this is kinda risky, so go get the fuck back, don't worry about the rebound if they save my shot".

- **On Your Wing**: I am ready for a pass or challenge that sends the ball sideways, but still a bit forward. I might not be close enough to you to come in and take the ball after a challenge.

- **Following**: I am in position to swoop in if you take a 50/50 and the ball dies or bounces in the area. I am probably too close for any kind of pass other than a tee-up, light pop, or small wall bounce.

- **Cross**: Ball should or will go straight left-to-right or right-to-left across the field. A cross goes across the backboard, maybe behind the opponents, and an infield goes further away from the backboard.

- **Infield**: A play from the outer edge to the center area that goes in front of the opponents net. [Example 1](https://www.gifyourgame.com/MatureFledgelingAjidomarujido). [Example 2](https://www.gifyourgame.com/IntentVirileMonarlaishalver)

- **Deep**: I am in offensive position closer to midfield, further away from the opponents net. If you are centering, hit it higher and/or further from the backboard, away from the opponents. If 2 is too close to a deep pass, it could go over their head and into a counter-attack.

- - Muddy called out “deep” for this play, and I changed from trying to pinch the ball across the net to hitting it out into center: https://www.gifyourgame.com/SequinedParKuja

- **Tight**: Opposite of 'deep'. Pass is going 1-5 car-lengths in front of their net. Deep/Tight are used when talking about passing only in front of the opponents' net.

- **Stay Loose**: Stay a bit further back and with boost, be prepared.

- **xyz okay**: "*Backboard okay*", "*Infield okay*", etc. The word "okay" turns a command into an option. The speaker is likely off the ball. They do not know the first player's best option. They are just being informative. Otherwise, player A can sometimes assume the called play is the best play from the callers point of view. various teammates' different synergies will affect this. 

- - *For example, if I'm dribbling, Kasey could shout "Backboard okay". This basically now means "go for the flick, but you could go top-shelf. If you sky it, or crossbar it, I am ready". Sometimes the "okay" is implied, and calling out plays is just calling out options.*

- **Pop**: or 'pop it'. A pop is the opposite of a drop - one is hitting it basically straight up. The height/power of the pop is important to communicate (a single jump pop vs. a backflip flick), so "low pop" or "high pop" might be good to say....

- **Bang:** Hit the ball very hard. Hopefully towards a teammate who shouted “bang” and is downfield waiting on it, or at the opponents net. Or a big clear.

- **No Bang:** I cannot hit the ball very hard. If you are downfield waiting for it, you should probably rotate back.

- **Shoot** or **Open**. Lets you know what you should be doing with the ball, even if you think more touches or another pass is the confident play. Don’t dribble-flick an open net.

- **Works** or **Fine:** “It may seem like what just happened was a mistake or bad, but fear not! It’s actually fine, and there is some play we can continue making here”

- - Fine is the same thing but on defense: “Don’t panic”.
  - You often hear pro players say "Good" after mistakes. They don't mean "good job messing up", theyre just saying "this is fine, don't panic" with less syllables.

- **Behind You**: “You’re about to get demod”

- **Yoink:** To take a big boost right before someone else. For opponents, you say “stolen”. They stole it, you stole theirs, etc. For teammates, you can say “yoink” after taking the boost by way for an unhelpful and annoying ironic apology. Never say ‘yoink’ *before* taking it from a teammate, because it means you did on purpose and still chose to take the boost. Counterpoint: Do say it, it's hilarious.

- **Trip-Up** or **Trip**: Driving under an opponent while they are landing, slowing them down, spinning them out, or messing them up. Sometimes done by the retreating player, instead of rotating away from the play. 

- **I believe**: I believe that you are doing something that you do not normally do, and I would not normally be in position for. Like a crazy double touch or flip reset pass. I trust you to do this thing, I will be in position for it.

- - We also call “believe” on opponents. Like “I don’t believe” while an opponent is going for a crazy flip reset. "I don't believe" means “I’m calling their bluff. If they score it’s on me, but I would rather be ready to punish them when they fail at this.”

- **Trust** or **I read these**: You think you should be going for the ball, but don’t, because I got it. Hold my beer, check out what I am going to do. "I read these" is "I correctly figured out where this crazy bounce is going and I will meet it, it's gonna be nuts so, hey, don't double commit"

- **Read Me**: I do not have time to communicate where this ball is going to go, but *I don't care, just figure it out* because it’s going to you. A pinch pass, or weird aerial touch perhaps.

- **Awkward:** One of the most important shouts. "I am having or going to have a tough time with this one". It means that the ball will take longer to get to than one might expect, **and/or** that when one gets to the ball, their play/touch on the ball won’t be very good. An unexpected bounce may cause one to be awkward. When one calls awkward, they are saying *“If the other team is just going to beat me to this, let me know so I can rotate out faster. If you have an easier or better touch on this, go for it and call it cus I don’t like love this situation I am in.”*

  - It's also great to call when the opponents are awkward, as it tends to be punishable. We can adjust to more aggressive positioning.

- **Time:** “Time” means “You have time and do not need to rush”. Usually it means you either have time to catch the ball, or you have time to let it land and you can half-volley it powerfully, instead of weaker aerial touch. Easy to miscommunicate ‘time’, one may want to just call out the command like “half-volley” or “catch it”, which implicitly communicates how much time one has to do that.

  - Very often "Time" has been followed up with "Not that much time!" in our comms.

- **Control:** Similar to “time”, it means you have time to catch the ball or take two touches before a challenge. Touch once, observe, and prepare to do something next. It does not mean “you need to dribble this” (for that, just say ‘dribble’). 

- - Alternatively: “Don’t just whack it back at the other team, we have options”

- **Go Up: “**I do not care if you have a strong challenge, good clear, or even confidence you can reach the ball. I need you to get your car closer to the ball in the air so you can cut off some of the angles, like a blocker in volleyball. Even if you miss or they get it around you, I have less area to cover thanks to your sacrificial lunge. Also this needs to happen like *yesterday* so freaking *jump already*. Also consider: “**Im Grounded”** or **“I’m Ground”** to help communicate these kinds of defensive situations.

- **They’re Up:** Somebody from the other team is going for the ball. I.e.: Don’t go, be ready for a challenge, look out for a shot, etc.

- **Backboard:** Hit the ball off of the backboard - a very awkward position for the defense, if they don’t have a player up there - so a teammate can fly up and score a sick “backboard read”. (If no teammate, it’s a “double”). On defense, this can mean "I am on our backboard."

- **You’re Last:** Play safe, you do not have support and probably won’t until we call that we’re back. 

- **Just One:** Like “You’re last” for the other team - only one player left to beat. Play accordingly.

- **Hello**: After one player calls "High" that a shot is going high/hitting backboard, a teammate should reply "Hello." in order to annoy them. Its an overused joke, but that's why it's funny.
